# CustomFunctions

-- Wanted to challange myself by creating custom mathmatical functions without using and built-in functions/tools

-- newMath.round() function shortens the floating point number to the desired decimal point and then rounds from there (if you want there to be 3 decimal points, the input decimal place value should be 4 (always 1 less then the desired lenght))
